RD\ and WR\ are low when the processor wants to read or write to external memory, so the output of the AND gate is low when the processor wants to access external memory in any way.
The OR gate going to RAM_1 is low when both A15 and the AND gate output are low, which means RAM_1 gets enabled when RD\ or WR\ is low, and A15 is low. 
Thus, RAM_1 is accessed by any addresses where A15 is 0.

To access the other devices, the 74HC138 requires CS0/ and CS1/ to be low, and CS2 to be high for the 8 way decoder to be enabled (otherwise all the outputs are high). 
A12, A13, and A14 select which device gets the active low signal.
For any of the outputs to go low, A15 must be high.
Assuming the outputs are 0 to 7 from top to bottom, and inputs are LSB to MSB from top to bottom, RAM_4 is accessed when A12, A14, and A15 are high, for example. 

The full memory mapping is:

| Address         | Device   | DPTR = [A15 - A0]   |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| 0x0000 - 0x7FFF | RAM_1    | 0xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0x8000 - 0x8FFF | EEPROM_1 | 1000 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0x9000 - 0x9FFF | RAM_2    | 1001 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xA000 - 0xAFFF | INPUT    | 1010 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xB000 - 0xBFFF | OUTPUT   | 1011 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xC000 - 0xCFFF | RAM_3    | 1100 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xD000 - 0xDFFF | RAM_4    | 1101 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xE000 - 0xEFFF | RAM_5    | 1110 xxxx xxxx xxxx |
| 0xF000 - 0xFFFF | EEPROM_2 | 1111 xxxx xxxx xxxx |

Thus to copy the first 75 bytes from RAM_4 to RAM_5, the processor must copy xram bytes [0xD000:0xD04A] to [0xE000:0xE04A]
```asm
copy_75:
    mov R7,  #0x75
    mov DPL, #0
copy:
    mov DPH, #0xD0
    movx A, @dptr
    mov DPH, #0xE0
    movx @dptr, A
    inc DPL
    djnz R7, copy
    ret
```
